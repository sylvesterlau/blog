# Peeling, Healing
The UX of Skin - week 2

```
Team: Catherine Achieng, Damul Yang, Jinsong (Sylvester) Liu.
```

CHolding [the initial model from last week](/skin-1), we moved on to a deeper dive refining the prototype. The first problem we encountered is the scale and material. We discussed a torso sized model, but I think it is more related to moulting than Dermatophagia (biting skin from fingers). Besides, we are not confident about making a full-body size model in a week during the lockdown. So our group agreed to focus on building a more polished skin-peeling experience. 

## Prototype 1: Hand Model
he primary idea is to apply abstract drawing (joyful feeling) on wood and add plaster bandage with text (anxious feeling) as peel-able skin. However, the wood manikin I brought online is too small, and not suitable for acrylic paint. Due to miscommunication, we spend too much time on this one.

## Prototype 2: Human Hand
So after serval conversation, we decided to demonstrate the idea on Damul’s We decided to demonstrate using a human hand. Damul painted her hand a day before the final presentation, and we gathered in the studio to finish the last touch of plaster bandage. In the meantime, Cat brought another hand manikin and some face seaweed facial mask for an extra attempt.

## Final Presentation
We finished the prototype at the last minute. Following a brief introduction, Damul came up with a paper bag covering her hand, revealed our work by performing the peeling (or more like ripping) process. Sadly, the class could not see the text up close, resulting in incompleted experience and understanding.

It is worth noting that our hand manikin, surprisingly, started ‘moulting’ after our presentation. It achieved an unexpected artistic condition when some classmates have a chance to take a closer look before leaving.

## Feedback and Thoughts
Although the prototype explicitly manifests our notion, Alastair noted its **limitation in scale**. I might lack ambitions and hold too much on the original idea. That is why we didn’t go more in-depth and explore further. One practical tip from Alastair is using photos or videos to **emphasise the result** when showing something delicate.

Also, the question **‘What would it be in the world?’** rose for every group. Is it a product? Or an exhibit? Or both? We did not consider a specific context. An experience could be anything from a song to the Disney land.

Working with Damul and Cat is delighted! I am pleased with the journey, although some stumble in the middle. 

Next week, we will talk about [the mystery of memory](https://blog.sylvesterlau.com/memory-distortion).
